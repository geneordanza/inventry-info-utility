Run an XML-RPC agent on the host server.  The XML-RPC service would gather all
host information and other (proprietary) info on the server and relay them over
port 9000 upon request from a client running on Linux bastion.

TODO1: Get info from (proprietary) application once the scope of data to be
retrieve has been finalized.

TODO2: Check out Nagios, might be easier to write plugin there.
